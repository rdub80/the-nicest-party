# The Nicest Party:

## Audio recordings of people saying nice things

A [nice project tweet](https://twitter.com/DaniGatunes/status/1384700454626594817) prompted a [nice thread](https://twitter.com/TrevorFSmith/status/1384701449238573057) about asking nice people to say nice things so that we can make nice digital crowds.

Think of your favorite video game or VR space or spatial audio site and then make it just the nicest possible party. That's the vibe!

## Are you a nice person who wants to be part of the nicest party?

To make this all work you'll need to (1) contribute your audio recording and (2) contribute a text note that says that your audio is released under the [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). That lets people use the audio for non-commercial stuff as long as they give attribution if they release anything with it.

Basically, have fun with this but don't go being all hypercorp about it.

## Sounds good! Now what?

If you're a git-using type of person then the easiest way to be one of the nice people is to create a nice pull request that creates a new directory under `/audio/` with some unique name (your person-style name, your favorite pet's name, anything except not-niceties really) that contains your audio recording and a copy of [this attribution file]() (TBD) with your name and email instead of "YOUR NAME" and "EMAIL".

If you're a non-git-using type of person (and that's most of us!) then DM [me @TrevorFSmith@Twitter.com](https://twitter.com/TrevorFSmith) and I'll give you deets on how to contribute using that sweet, sweet email (of all things!). If this goes viral (and I really hope that it doesn't) then I'll have to close up DMs but if everybody is nice about it then DMs and email can work just fine.

## Then what?

I (Trevor) will eventually normalize all of the audio clips into a nice consistent format but you can make my life easier by contributing your recording as a WAV file. Don't sweat it too much, but you know, if it's easy peasy then WAV is nice.

## I (don't like my voice | am not comfy with sharing | feel stressed about this) but want to use the clips

No worries! Just abide (like The Dude) by the CC license and enjoy.

Hashtagies nice.
